    "content_Sunflower_01":"The first time I ever saw sunflower fields was during a train trip I took when I was younger. Mesmerized with the yellow field, the sight of sunflowers brought me immense joy. Fast forward to
    2021, when covid cases are low and the government had lifted bans from traveling between states, I was still scrolling through instagram feeds when one of my friends posted a picture amid sunflowers. The obsession I had from years back, came in flowing and I started to cry at the sight of
    the pictures. And have been planning for the big trip ever since. It was after late August that year I had come to know about the fields in Sundarapandiapuram and visiting them was not an option
    as they had started the harvesting and I would never be able to make it to fields to get them in their full glory.",

    "content_Sunflower_02" :"Being at one point you get to cross the bridge and you get the view of the dam that stands tall between the trees on both the sides. The calming darker shades of green around us has now changed
    to more of a bright green view as we cross the borders and checkposts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Two sides of a mountain, one with a darker side, more cooler and the other bright and windy.
    The lime tinted paddy fields, clear blue sky and the mountains that surrounded us in a crescent shape taking up the borders of Tenkasi kept us company. Each scene we had passed by there was 
    something to look at, when you feel like you have seen enough of the fields, standing tall from the ground were windmills. Large group of cacti and asian palmyra palm that bears ice apples 
    (or nonku in Malayalam) guarded the roads and the large farm lands."
